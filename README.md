<h3>Poem</h3>

<p>Our generation will be known for nothing.<br>
Never will anybody say,<br>
We were the peak of mankind.<br>
That is wrong, the truth is<br>
Our generation was a failure.<br>
Thinking that<br>
We actually succeeded<br>
Is a waste. And we know<br>
Living only for money and power<br>
Is the way to go.<br>
Being loving, respectful, and kind<br>
Is a dumb thing to do.<br>
Forgetting about that time,<br>
Will not be easy, but we will try.<br>
Changing our world for the better<br>
Is something we never did.<br>
Giving up<br>
Was how we handled our problems.<br>
Working hard<br>
Was a joke.<br>
We knew that<br>
People thought we couldnâ€™t come back<br>
That might be true,<br>
Unless we turn things around</p>
